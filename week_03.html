                Hi, my name is Nikki and I am currently a stay at home mom to my 3 year old son 
                after losing my job due to the pandemic. I figured now is a great time for
                a career change or at least to learn something new! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born in Pennsylvania but grew up in North Carolina and have been living in Louisiana for the last 11 years.
                In the list below, are four facts about me.
